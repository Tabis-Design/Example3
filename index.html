                <p>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. The club was
                    formed in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, and played its first competitive match on 13 May 1902, when
                    it lost 3-1 in the semi-final of the Campeonato de Copa de S.M. Alfonso XIII against FC
                    Barcelona. Real Madrid played against other local clubs in various regional tournaments, that
                    served as qualifiers for the Copa del Rey, from 1902 to 1940. In 1929, the club became one of the
                    founding members of La Liga, Spain's first national league. As of 2022, Real is one of only three
                    clubs never to have been relegated from the top level of Spanish football, the others being Athletic
                    Bilbao and Barcelona.</p><br>
                <p>
                    From 1902 to 1929, Real won the Copa del Rey five times and the regional championship 15 times. Real
                    Madrid had a successful start in La Liga, finishing second in the competition's first season, and
                    winning the league in 1932 for the first time. In the 1947-48 season, Madrid finished eleventh,
                    which remains, as of 2022, the club's lowest final position. Real Madrid won La Liga four times
                    and the European Cup five times during the 1950s. However, the most successful period for the club
                    in terms of domestic titles was the 1960s, when Real Madrid won eight league championships. It won
                    its first double of league championship and national cup in 1962. Real is also the only Spanish
                    football team to win five consecutive titles, a feat which it has achieved on two occasions (1960-65
                    and 1985-90).</p><br>
                <p>In addition to their domestic success, Real Madrid's reputation as a major club was established by
                    their outstanding record in the European Cup. To date, they have been crowned champions of Europe a
                    record fourteen times. Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás and other famous players helped the club
                    win the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included a memorable 7-3
                    Hampden Park final against German side Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. The club won the trophy for a
                    sixth time in 1966 with a team known as the Ye-Ye that defeated Yugoslavian club Partizan 2-1 in the
                    final while being composed entirely of Spanish-born players, a first in the competition. They were
                    also runners-up in 1962, 1964 and 1981. Winning the competition five consecutive times saw Real
                    permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear a multiple-winner badge since
                    2000. They have also won the UEFA Cup twice and were twice runners-up in the European Cup Winners'
                    Cup.</p><br>
                <p>In 1996, president Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach. Although his tenure lasted only one
                    season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions and several important players arrived at the
                    club, such as Roberto Carlos, Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker and Clarence Seedorf, to strengthen a
                    squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result,
                    Real Madrid, with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997, finally ended its 32-year wait for the
                    seventh European Cup in 1998 under manager Jupp Heynckes, defeating Juventus 1–0 in the final thanks
                    to a goal from Mijatović. Real Madrid would go on to win again in 2000, 2002 (under manager Vicente
                    del Bosque), 2014 (under manager Carlo Ancelotti), 2016, 2017, 2018 (under manager Zinedine Zidane),
                    and 2022 (again under Ancelotti). Madrid are also seven-time winners of the Intercontinental
                    Cup/FIFA Club World Cup, defeating Peñarol, Vasco da Gama, Olimpia Asunción, San Lorenzo, Kashima
                    Antlers, Grêmio and Al Ain in 1960, 1998, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively.</p>
